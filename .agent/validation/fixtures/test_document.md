# Test Markdown Document

This is a **markdown** document used for upload validation testing.

## Section 1: Purpose

This file verifies that the ingestion pipeline correctly handles `.md` files:
- File type detection
- Storage upload
- Text extraction
- Chunking
- Embedding

## Section 2: Content

The content here is intentionally simple. It exists to verify the processing pipeline, not to test retrieval quality.

### Subsection 2.1

Some additional text to ensure the document has enough content to be chunked properly during ingestion.

## Section 3: Conclusion

If this document uploads successfully and transitions to "completed" status, the markdown upload path is working correctly.
